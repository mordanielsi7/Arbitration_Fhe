# Arbitration FHE: Confidential Dispute Resolution Powered by Zama

Arbitration FHE is a decentralized arbitration system powered by **Zama's Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) technology**. Designed specifically for resolving smart contract disputes, this innovative solution encrypts all related transaction data and evidence using FHE, allowing a professional and anonymous DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) arbitration panel to deliver privacy-first judgments. With the rise of decentralized finance (DeFi) and complex smart contracts, the need for a reliable and confidential dispute resolution system is more critical than ever.

## The Challenge of Smart Contract Disputes

Smart contracts operate on immutable blockchain technology, simplifying transactions and agreements. However, when disputes arise—whether due to breached terms or misinterpretations—the traditional judicial systems are often ill-equipped to handle the nuances of blockchain-related issues. The lack of confidentiality and the transparency of the blockchain can expose sensitive information, making the resolution process cumbersome and risky for involved parties. Arbitration FHE tackles these challenges head-on.

## A Transformative FHE Solution

Utilizing Zama's advanced FHE libraries—specifically **Concrete** and **TFHE-rs**—Arbitration FHE ensures that all data remains encrypted throughout the dispute resolution process. This means that arbitrators can vote and make decisions without ever accessing the raw data, preserving the confidentiality of the parties involved. Moreover, the system's homomorphic properties allow us to perform computations on encrypted data, enabling vote tallying and case assessments to occur securely and privately.

### How It Works:
1. **Data Encryption:** All relevant dispute data is encrypted using FHE, preventing unauthorized access during resolution.
2. **Anonymous Voting:** Arbitrators cast their votes on proposals through homomorphic encryption, ensuring their choices remain confidential.
3. **Final Judgment:** The system compiles the votes and data securely, granting a transparent but private resolution to the dispute.

## Core Functionalities

- **FHE Encryption for Data Confidentiality:** All case-related data and evidence remain private throughout the arbitration process.
- **Homomorphic Voting Mechanism:** Arbitrators can vote on case outcomes without revealing individual votes.
- **Decentralized Decision-Making:** An anonymous DAO handles disputes, providing a professional and impartial panel for judgment.
- **Robust Case Management System:** Designed for ease of use, the interface allows parties to manage their cases effectively.

## Technology Stack

The Arbitration FHE project integrates several key technologies to provide a seamless experience for users:
- **Zama's Fully Homomorphic Encryption Libraries:** Concrete, TFHE-rs
- **Solidity:** Smart contract language for Ethereum
- **Node.js:** JavaScript runtime for backend services
- **Hardhat:** Ethereum development environment for compiling and deploying smart contracts

## Getting Started: Installation Guide

Before you set up Arbitration FHE, ensure you have the following software installed:
- **Node.js** (version 14 or later)
- **Hardhat** (for Ethereum development)

### Setup Instructions

1. **Download the Project:**
   - Ensure you have the latest version of Node.js installed.
   - Download the project files directly.

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   - Navigate to the project directory and run the command below. This will install all necessary dependencies, including the Zama FHE libraries.

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Build & Run the Project

Once your environment is set up, you can compile and deploy the smart contracts. Follow these steps:

### Compile Smart Contracts

To compile the smart contracts, run the following command:

```bash
npx hardhat compile
```

### Deploy Contracts

To deploy the contracts to a test network, execute:

```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network <network_name>
```

Replace `<network_name>` with your desired Ethereum test network (e.g., Rinkeby, Ropsten).

### Running Tests

To perform unit and integration tests, use:

```bash
npx hardhat test
```

This command will execute all the tests in the `test` directory to ensure that everything functions as expected.

## Example Usage

Here's a brief code snippet demonstrating how to interact with the arbitration smart contract:

```javascript
const { ethers } = require("hardhat");

async function main() {
    const ArbitrationFhe = await ethers.getContractFactory("Arbitration_Fhe");
    const arbitration = await ArbitrationFhe.deploy();
    
    console.log("Arbitration contract deployed to:", arbitration.address);
    
    // Example of submitting a case
    const caseDetails = {
        parties: ["0xAddress1", "0xAddress2"],
        evidence: ["encryptedEvidence1", "encryptedEvidence2"],
    };

    await arbitration.submitCase(caseDetails);
    console.log("Case submitted successfully.");
}

main().catch((error) => {
    console.error(error);
    process.exitCode = 1;
});
```

In this example, we deploy the Arbitration contract and submit a dispute case encrypted for privacy using the system's functionalities.
